This project show you a very easy way to have a cell highlighting under mouse cursor with TileMapLayer node.

It uses a mere Sprite2D put in the right cell using map <-> screen coordinates conversion feature of TileMapLayer object.

It also, and mostly, allows you to customize the highlight with ease in order to make it a ghost version of a unit or a building to put on the board for instance, make it a (animated or not) crosshair to move a unit to this cell or add a shader to play with the underlying tile texture.
